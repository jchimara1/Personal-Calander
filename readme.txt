The additional reports that i choose to run was a tableview of the Division level and which customers belong to which division level, it auto updates when a new customer is added to the show the user the breakdown of customers in different division level.
I also made a break down of type and its total count and a breakdown of appointments and their months and its total count both appear in separate tableviews so the user can quickly count the amount of appointments  in a single month and the total amount of appointments of a specfic type.
